</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>Unlike other online video editing tools you find these days, Renderforest is a template-based online video maker that helps you create videos faster. It comes with everything you need to make videos that catch people's eyes, like</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">

<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>You can create mentioned videos with cool transition effects. The video editing process is divided into four sections, which I have explained in the section below:</p>

<h4 class="">Editing</h4>

<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>With Renderforest, editing video is as easy as dragging and dropping your files onto the platform. Select a topic and a preferred video style from their extensive template library. Then, you insert your videos accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To begin editing, you have options to pick from:</span></p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<ul class="">
	<li>Readymade videos that come with the template,Â </li>
	<li>Use stock footage from their extensive library orÂ </li>
	<li>Start from scratch by adding your own files from a local drive.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once done, you can make simple changes like adding text, choosing fonts, changing text size, swapping text positions, and adding scene duration.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Note:Â </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It's worth mentioning that different subscription plans have different limitations on uploading media files to the platform. With the Renderforest Pro plan, I could upload 4096 MB worth of files at one time.<br />

<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>Each slide's duration can range from 5 to 15 seconds for slide post videos and whiteboard-style animations. However, in the case of intro and comprehensive videos, you can shorten the video's length by trimming the uploaded video and crafting your diary.</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Impression:Â </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">I suggest considering Renderforest, particularly for quickly crafting intros, outros, slide presentations, and whiteboard animations. It excels in handling these tasks efficiently. However, if you want more control over your video editing process, you can try other online video makers likeÂ FlexClipÂ orÂ Clipchamp.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<h4 class="">Style</h4>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>In the style part of Renderforest, you can choose from various transitions they have in specific template libraries and use them in your video. It changes the whole appearance of your video content. You can also decide what fonts to use in your video and their animation style.</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<h4 class="">Adding Music</h4>

<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>You can put music in your video by choosing from your music collection or using the songs available on the platform. But keep in mind that the platform's music choices are limited.</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>You can also record your voice using the voiceover tool. In addition, you can add computer-generated voices for the text during the video editing process using the text-to-speech feature.</p>

<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>After you finish editing, you can watch a preview of your video in three different formats, depending on your subscription plan. With the Renderforest Pro subscription, I could preview and export the video in 360P, HD 720P, and HD 1080P. The exporting process was fast, unlike other online video editing tools I've tried previously. Once exported, you can share the file via social media platforms like Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, Reddit, YouTube, Linkedin, and X (formerly known as Twitter).</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Note:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Â It's important to remember that using this tool means sacrificing some of the hands-on control found in other advanced desktop-based video editing software likeÂ </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Movavi Video Editor</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Â andÂ </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wondershare Filmora</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. You won't have access to advanced features such as precise text customization, color grading, detailed keyframing, etc.<br />

<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>Additionally,Â <span data-preserver-spaces="true">in case you need the ability toÂ <strong>export in 4K, you can upgrade your subscription to the Business plan</strong>.</span></p>

<p>Creating a website no longer requires expert skills; Renderforest has everything you need. They offer an impressive array of website templates for businesses, personal portfolios, events, and art showcases. You can start from scratch or modify existing templates to establish your online presence from their platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>Renderforest enables you to effortlessly expand your website by adding pages. However, your choices for page elements are confined to the components available in the platform's library. You can seamlessly integrate those elements into your webpage, including features, text, call-to-action buttons, email forms, and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>A notable feature I found during my Renderforest review is the "Widget" section. It simplifies integrating messaging and live chat functionalities like Intercom, Freshchat, and Jivochat. Additionally, you can effortlessly connect your Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Viber accounts for social media integrations. Adding these features onto your website is as simple as copying a code or ID and pasting it into your site.</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element" data-css="tve-u-18a2b41a42a">
<p>Another factor that adds to this feature's usefulness is its ability to engage collaborators in enhancing your website. It enables you to grant access to individuals to edit and redesign web pages. It can be achieved by simply sharing a link with the desired collaborator.</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Note:Â </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During my Renderforest review, I observed a missing element: a search bar within the website builder.

<p>Renderforest's logo maker empowers you to design logos for your business or personal brand in just a few simple steps. You can begin to design your logo by:</p>

<h3 id="t-1692874816487" class="">Advantages</h3>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>Getting used to working with Renderforest was a little challenging, especially since I'm more accustomed to manual editing than relying on simple drag-and-drop functionalities. However, Renderforest ultimately simplified the process for me. After conducting my Renderforest review, I discovered that the platform is incredibly user-friendly for branding needs, offering customized designs and templates.</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<ul class="">
	<li>Renderforest operates as an efficient online video creator, capable of producing high-quality videos quickly.</li>
	<li>Â While it differs from traditional video editing software, it proves highly advantageous for individuals seeking a fast, easy, and creative approach to video creation through templates.</li>
	<li>The platform's extensive collection of stock media footage elevates the professional and aesthetic quality of videos, particularly explainer videos.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>Beyond its impressive array of templates, Renderforest's customization options are truly praiseworthy. All edited files are securely stored in its cloud, providing easy access anytime. You can locate your saved projects in the "My Files" section, including uploaded media files like images, videos, sounds, and fonts. Additionally, you're given the flexibility to organize media files into new folders for enhanced organization.</p>

<h3 id="t-1692874816488" class="">Disadvantages</h3>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<p>Despite its efficiency, Renderforest does come with a few downsides.</p>
</div>
<div class="thrv_wrapper thrv_text_element">
<ul class="">
	<li>The primary drawback I encountered while using the platform was its outdated and monotonous templates and elements. I think having a better variety of imaginative and visually engaging templates and elements would be more appealing.</li>
	<li>Additionally, I faced the limitation of customization options. While the platform is efficient, having slightly more room for customization would be advantageous in creating more engaging videos, designs, mockups, and logos.</li>

<div class="question">
<h3 class="title">Why You Wonâ€™t Always Find A Working Coupon Code Renderforest</h3>
<i class="fa fa-angle-down icon" aria-hidden="true"></i></div>
<div class="answer">
<p>There are several reasons why aÂ <strong>Renderforest</strong>Â coupon code may not work. The code might have exclusions, it could be expired, or it might be non-transferrable and can only be used once. It's also possible that the promo code was not applied to the order because the amount was not high enough. Additionally, if a code is entered incorrectly or is a fake coupon code, it will not work. The only way to successfully redeem a coupon is to receive it directly from Renderforest. All Renderforest coupon codes provided by a third party are invalid. Therefore, it's always a good idea to check the validity of a coupon code before using it.</p>
